- [ ] Anti-patterns avoided or mitigated
- [ ] New code follows established patterns

**Pattern Consistency Score:** \_\_\_/10

### Component Coupling and Cohesion

- [ ] High cohesion within components/modules
- [ ] Low coupling between components/modules
- [ ] Dependencies flow in consistent direction
- [ ] Circular dependencies avoided

**Coupling/Cohesion Score:** \_\_\_/10

## Scalability and Performance

### System Scalability Patterns

- [ ] Stateless components where appropriate
- [ ] Database scaling strategy defined

- [ ] Resource pooling implemented

**Scalability Score:** \_\_\_/10

### Performance Architecture Review

- [ ] Database query patterns optimized
- [ ] Caching strategy implemented appropriately
- [ ] Resource utilization efficient
- [ ] Network communication optimized

**Performance Score:** \_\_\_/10

## Technical Debt Assessment

### Architectural Technical Debt

**Debt Level:** [LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL]

**Major Debt Items:**

1. **Area:** [component/system area]

   **Impact:** [current and future cost]
   **Priority:** [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]

## Architecture Recommendations

### Immediate (Critical Issues)

1. **Issue:** [critical problem]
   **Risk:** [what could go wrong]
   **Fix:** [specific action needed]

### Strategic (Long-term Health)

1. **Improvement:** [strategic enhancement]
   **Benefit:** [long-term value]
   **Timeline:** [when to implement]

## Overall Assessment

- **Design Patterns:** \_\_\_/10

      query: (jobId) => `/api/v1/decompile/${jobId}`,
      // Results are included in job status response when status is 'completed'
    }),
    // No separate endpoints needed - all results data is in job status response
    // Analysis results are accessed via job.results.* properties
    getJobWithResults: builder.query<AnalysisResults, string>({
      query: (jobId) => `/api/v1/decompile/${jobId}`,

## Feature Overview

**Feature Name:** Analysis Job Management System  
**Brief Description:** A comprehensive job submission, tracking, and history management interface that handles binary file analysis through a unified job-based workflow with real-time status polling and results access.

**Problem Statement:** Software engineers and security researchers need an efficient way to submit analysis jobs, track their progress in real-time, manage job history, and access results from previous analyses without complex workflow management overhead.

**Feature Goals:**
- Provide streamlined job submission with file upload, configuration, and LLM provider selection
- Maintain real-time job progress tracking via REST polling at 1-2 second intervals  
- Enable comprehensive job history management with quick access to previous results
- Support job cancellation and retry functionality for workflow flexibility
- Offer professional job management interface suitable for developer workflows

**User Value Proposition:**
- **For Software Engineers:** Unified job workflow that integrates file upload, configuration, and tracking in a single interface
- **For Security Researchers:** Efficient job management with clear status tracking and historical analysis access
- **For All Users:** Real-time progress visibility with professional interface design and reliable job control

**Connection to Project Objectives:**
- Enables the primary user journey: "Submit analysis job via single endpoint (file + configuration)"
- Supports the project goal of "unified workflow control for software engineers"
- Contributes to the "job-based architecture with single submission endpoint" architectural decision

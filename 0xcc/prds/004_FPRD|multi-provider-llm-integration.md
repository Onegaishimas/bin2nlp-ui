const llmProviderApi = api.injectEndpoints({
  endpoints: (builder) => ({
    listProviders: builder.query<ProviderListResponse, void>({
      query: () => '/api/v1/llm-providers',
      // Get all available providers with capabilities
    }),
    getProviderDetails: builder.query<ProviderDetails, string>({
      query: (providerId) => `/api/v1/llm-providers/${providerId}`,
      // Get detailed information about specific provider
    }),
    checkProviderHealth: builder.mutation<HealthCheckResponse, string>({
      query: (providerId) => ({
        url: `/api/v1/llm-providers/${providerId}/health-check`,
        method: 'POST',
      }),
      // Test provider availability and response time
    }),
    // No credential validation endpoints - credentials are user-managed
    // No model listing endpoints - models are in provider details
    // Provider selection and API keys are managed client-side only
  }),
});
```

**Job Submission Integration:**
- Provider selection and API keys included in job submission FormData

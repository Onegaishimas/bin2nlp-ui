# Project PRD: bin2nlp Web Frontend

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** bin2nlp-frontend

**Brief Description:** A modern React/TypeScript web interface that provides a comprehensive frontend for the bin2nlp two-phase binary decompilation and LLM translation pipeline, enabling software engineers to analyze binary files through an intuitive web application.

**Vision Statement:** Create a professional, developer-friendly web interface that exposes the complete bin2nlp workflow - from binary upload through radare2 decompilation to LLM-powered natural language translation - with enterprise-grade performance, multi-provider LLM support, and comprehensive analysis tools.

**Problem Statement:** Software engineers and security researchers need an accessible way to understand binary files through decompilation and natural language translation, but currently lack a modern web interface that can handle the complete two-phase pipeline (decompilation → LLM translation) with professional tooling and multi-provider LLM integration.

**Success Definition:** A fully-featured web application that achieves 95% of operations completing in under 10 seconds, supports all major LLM providers from launch, and provides developer-friendly interfaces for binary analysis workflows.

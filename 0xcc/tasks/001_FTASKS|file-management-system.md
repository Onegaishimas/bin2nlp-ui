### Notes

- Unit tests should be placed alongside the code files they are testing
- Use `npm test` to run all tests found by the Jest configuration
- RTK Query API tests should mock HTTP requests using MSW (Mock Service Worker)
- Component tests should use React Testing Library for user interaction testing
- Integration tests should verify Redux state management and API coordination
